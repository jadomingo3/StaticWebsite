	<div>Although Sugar & Spice has been around for over a decade, there is a new owner who is a former intern and has taken over the Sugar & Spice name and will continue to give the best service possible. Athena has been a baker for over 20 years. She graduated from the Center for Culinary Arts, Manila in 2012 and officially became a Pastry Chef. The former owner has entrusted the legacy with Athena and believe me, she will strive to continue the excellence that Jennifer has built.

Sugar & Spice started in Jennifer’s kitchen in the summer of 2007.
Jennifer loved baking cupcakes for friends, but ran out of cake mix. She decided for the first time to bake some cupcakes from scratch. Her friends’ reactions were incredible – the “best cupcakes they’d ever tasted,” they said!  They convinced her to go into the cupcake business and the rest, as they say, is history.
We love using the best ingredients we can find, including local and organic ingredients.  We believe in service with a smile!</div>
